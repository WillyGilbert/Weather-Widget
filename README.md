# Weather Widget

This is an application that allows the user to see the weather status of the current day, as well as the weather forecast for the next 5 days. The user should only enter the URL of the application and it will show all the information about the weather.

The program also displays the weather status using small images that describe the weather status. These images indicate if the weather is "light rain", "broken clouds", "clear sky" or others.

## How to run the program?

The program can be executed by entering the following address: `https://willygilbert.github.io/Weather-Widget/`

For programmers who clone the program they can run a local version of it by running the command `gulp`
